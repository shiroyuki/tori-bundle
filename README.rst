This is the official bundle for Tori Framework aiming to reduce the repeated tasks.

Currently, it is designed to enhance security implementation and the code is literally only compatible with the
development version of Tori Framework. There is no documentation at this point. So, if you are interested, please feel
free to read the code to your heart content.
